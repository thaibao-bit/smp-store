# smp-store
This is a django ecommercial website that i followed some tutorial on Youtube and custome some front-end feature and some function. Not to much but it's just for study purposes only.
I've deployed this project to an heroku host. https://simp-store.herokuapp.com/
And i didn't create Payment's features cause i think i've learn enought about that so.
